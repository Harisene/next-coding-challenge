# Michael's NextJS Coding Challenge

## The Challenge:
Some newb has made a mess of this code. There are TODOs that need finishing off, broken and questionable tests and the code itself is inefficient.  
Please fix up whatever mess you find to get this piece of work working well.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, `npm install`, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Run the testing and linting with `npm run test` and `npm run lint`.
